# ZombieGame
Full Fledged WIP
Started learning Git properly this time. Better late then never.


Initially starting to make my first FPS game and this would be a semi-open world game with zombie.
Using sourcetree to control version control and keeping everything udated as going on.


Hope to see myself playing the game on the other side.
